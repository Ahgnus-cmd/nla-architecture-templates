# Natural Language Architecture Templates

A small, opinionated starter kit for designing complex systems and AI-native operating models
using natural language as the primary architecture medium.

Instead of starting from code, these templates help you:
- Think in **layers, loops, and interfaces**
- Capture system structure in **plain language**
- Hand off clear architecture docs to yourself, engineers, or AI tools later

> This repo is not a framework and not a prompt library.
> It is a set of lightweight canvases for thinking and designing with language first.

## What's inside (v0.1)

- `templates/OS_Architecture_Canvas.md`  
  High-level canvas for OS-level or large system designs  
  (multi-layer, multi-loop, multi-agent, etc.)

- `templates/System_Flow_Template.md`  
  For a single feature, pipeline, or product flow that needs structure.

- `templates/Governance_Checklist.md`  
  Compact checklist to sanity-check risks, safety, and maintainability.

## How to use

1. **Pick a template**
   - For a big system / OS → use `OS_Architecture_Canvas.md`
   - For a specific feature / product flow → use `System_Flow_Template.md`

2. **Duplicate the file**
   - Copy it into your own repo, Notion, or any document tool.
   - Rename the file for your project.

3. **Fill it in with plain language**
   - Avoid code at first.
   - Focus on layers, flows, interfaces, constraints, and feedback loops.
   - Treat language as your “architecture DSL”.

4. (Optional) **Hand it to an LLM or an engineer**
   - Once the architecture is clear in language, you can generate:
     - diagrams
     - initial code skeletons
     - API contracts
     - test scenarios

## Who is this for?

- People who think in systems, not just in single prompts
- AI power users who want to move from "prompting" to **architecting**
- Engineers and researchers who like to sketch in language before coding
